# Welcome to TantraLab
<p align="justify">
Founded by Dr. Vishal Jain, a Translational Neuroscientist, TANTRA Lab is an incubator space at Carnegie Mellon University dedicated to building the next generation of neurotechnologies that bridge discovery and practice. Established within the Chamanzar Lab under the mentorship of Prof. Maysam Chamanzar and Prof. Pulkit Grover, TANTRA Lab integrates engineering, neuroscience, and clinical insight to design tools that advance how we sense, stimulate, and interface with the brain and body.
Our mission is to translate cutting-edge research into real-world solutions, from novel brain stimulation and neural recording platforms to innovative imaging and sensing technologies. By combining rigorous scientific exploration with a translational mindset, TANTRA Lab aims to create impactful systems that address pressing challenges in neuroscience, medicine, and human health.
